Sleep Faster
============

A cicle grows and shrinks on your phone screen. It helps you fall asleep maybe?

The idea is that if you time your breath with the pulsing light of the circle you can distract your brain, kind of like a form of meditation.

I mostly wanted to play around with [two.js](https://github.com/jonobr1/two.js) which is what this uses to create the circle. Although this is kind of a boring example so far.

Breath times are customizable through the query string (breathIn and breathOut)

TODO:
- test does this actually work for falling asleep?
- ~~make shape expand to full width of window~~
- ~~customizable breath in/breath out time~~
