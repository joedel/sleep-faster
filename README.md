Sleep Faster
============

Playing around with an idea that might help someone fall asleep faster. 

The idea is that if you time your breath with the light the phone screen gives off, you can distract your brain, kind of like a form of meditation.

Right now it's just a circle that grows and contracts.

I mostly wanted to play around with [two.js](https://github.com/jonobr1/two.js) which is what this uses to create the circle.


TODO:
- test does this actually work for falling asleep?
- make shape expand to full width of window
- customizable breath in/breath out time
